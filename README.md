# OreBreaker reborn
This is a new and heavily reworked version of the classic OreBreaker.
This version uses modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Zustand.
These choices make the project significantly more convenient for scaling and further development.

**This version is currently in Alpha testing, so the current code is intended for GitHub only.**
## Alpha 1.0:
Test commit: basic ore generation and player interaction implemented.
## Alpha 1.1
Added modals and Inventory
## Alpha 1.2
Added pickaxes logic and Howler.js sound support
A little redesign
